1. Code clean-up
2. Code formatting
3. Tests:
    a. Choose a testing framework
        * Would Mock be useful for emulating parts?
        * Have had Nose recommended to me, suitable for Python 2 and 3?
    b. Write basic tests:
        * Test the simple cache rebuild from terminal script works
        * Test menu functionality works in Python 2 and Python 3
    c. Write basic plugin tests (to ensure compatibility)
4. Versioning:
    a. Find out how other packages version (what would the AUR expect?)
    b. Test code, fix bugs, and start at version 0.1.
